[//]: # (Short description)

Examination project performed by me at the STEP Computer Academy.

The exam consisted of two tasks.

The first task is to write asynchronous chat on UDP, for many participants on
the local network. Implemented in WPF using the MVVM architectural pattern.
Also, adaptive markup is written.

The second task is to use the TCP protocol to synchronize the position of the
button on the server, according to its movement on the client.
That is, the client starts and you need to click the "Start" button to appear
on the server side. Then, by moving it to the "arrows" of the keyboard, it
moves on the server side.
